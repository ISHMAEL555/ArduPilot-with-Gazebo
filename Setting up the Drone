# Prelude: Forging the Weapon
In the coding forge of Python, we craft our tools like weapons for an impending aerial battle. 
The time has come to summon our allies, dronekit and time, to arm ourselves for the skies. 
With a stroke of code, we bring forth the components needed to control our flying war machines.
```bash 
    # Import Necessary Packages
  from dronekit import connect, VehicleMode, LocationGlobalRelative
  import time
