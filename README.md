# ArduPilot with Gazebo

This project demonstrates how to simulate ArduPilot drones in Gazebo using DroneKit for autonomous flight missions.

## Overview

- Uses **ArduPilot SITL** and **Gazebo** for drone simulation.
- Demonstrates basic takeoff and landing with a Python script using **DroneKit**.
- Can be extended for more complex missions and control algorithms.
